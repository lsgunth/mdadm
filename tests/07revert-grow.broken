always fails

This patch, recently added to md-next causes the test to always fail:

7e6ba434cc60 ("md: don't unregister sync_thread with reconfig_mutex held")

The errors are:

    mdadm: No active reshape to revert on /dev/loop0
    ERROR: active raid5 not found

Before the patch, the error seen is below.
