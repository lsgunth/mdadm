always fails

Fails with errors:

  ERROR: /dev/md0 isn't a block device.

Likely due to using 0.9 metadata. If metadata 0.9 is removed from the
test it fails with:

  mdadm: --update=super-minor not understood for 1.x metadata

  ERROR minors should be '0 0 1' but are '  '

Possibly irrelevant now that 0.9 metadata is unsupported?
