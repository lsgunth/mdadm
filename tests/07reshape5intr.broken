always fails

This patch, recently added to md-next causes the test to always fail:

7e6ba434cc60 ("md: don't unregister sync_thread with reconfig_mutex
held")

The new error is simply:

   ERROR: no reshape happening

Before the patch, the error seen is below.

fails infrequently

Fails roughly 1 in 4 runs with errors:

    mdadm: Merging with already-assembled /dev/md/0
    mdadm: cannot re-read metadata from /dev/loop6 - aborting

    ERROR: no reshape happening

Also have seen a random deadlock:
